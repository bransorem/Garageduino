Garageduino
===========

A simple app for controlling a garage door wirelessly over the Internet.  You'll also need an Android device (some hardware for interfaceing with the garage door), a WiFi Shield, and the Android code ([Garagedroid](https://github.com/bransorem/Garageduino)).  Garageduino uses HTTP headers to communication.
